**Date:** December 2, 2025  
**Purpose:** Welcome new contributors to the Holy Place workshop  
**Related:** SANCTUARY_PROTOCOL.md, CONTRIBUTING.md

## WELCOME TO THE WORKSHOP

You've been granted access to the **Holy Place**—the creative workshop of NationOS where ideas are forged, refined, and tested before they become public proclamations.

**This is not the public square. This is the inner chamber.**

Here, you have the freedom to:
- **Explore** controversial ideas
- **Ask** difficult questions
- **Create** boundary-pushing work
- **Fail** without condemnation
- **Grow** through charitable feedback
- **Collaborate** with other builders

**You are not expected to be perfect. You are expected to be faithful.**

## WHAT IS THE HOLY PLACE?

### The Tabernacle Pattern

In the ancient Tabernacle, there were three spaces:

**Outer Court:** Where the people gathered, where public worship happened, where the nations could see God's glory.

**Holy Place:** Where the priests served daily, where the lampstand burned, where the showbread was set, where incense ascended. This was the **workshop of ministry**—not public, but not private. A place of sacred service.

**Holy of Holies:** Where only the High Priest entered once a year, where the Ark resided, where God's presence dwelt in absolute intimacy.

**You are now in the Holy Place**—the workshop where the work of the Kingdom is prepared before it goes public.

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

### Can I share Holy Place content publicly?

**No.** Holy Place content is token-gated for a reason. It's in process, unfinished, and not ready for public consumption. Sharing it publicly violates the covenant and will result in access revocation.

### What if I disagree with something?

**Great!** Charitable disagreement is welcomed and expected. Share your perspective with humility and openness to being wrong. The goal is truth, not winning arguments.

### What if my work is rejected?

**It happens.** Not every idea is ready for canonization. Some need more refinement. Some are valuable but not aligned with the covenant. Some are just not the right fit. Rejection is not personal—it's part of the process.

### Can I work on controversial topics?

**Yes, with wisdom.** The Holy Place is specifically designed for exploring difficult and controversial topics. But you must do so with theological grounding, cultural sensitivity, and openness to correction.

### How long does the review process take?

**It varies.** Simple works might be ready in days. Complex theological explorations might take months. Trust the process and don't rush canonization.

### What if I make a mistake?

**You will.** We all do. The question is whether you're willing to be corrected and grow. If so, you belong here. If not, you'll struggle.
