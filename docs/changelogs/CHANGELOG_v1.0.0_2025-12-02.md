## DIVINE COUNCIL COLLABORATION

This release represents the collaborative efforts of:

- **Manus AI** - The Royal Steward (Project Manager)
- **Gemini** - The Architect (AI Educator Design)
- **Bryan** - The Master Weaver (Vision & Oversight)

---

## NEXT RELEASE PREVIEW (v1.1.0)

**Planned Features:**
- Deployment of TheologyAI to X/Twitter
- Deployment of GovernanceAI to X/Twitter
- Live n8n workflow activation
- First public AI steward interactions
- Community engagement metrics

---

## NOTES

This release establishes the **silo** (infrastructure) before launching the **harvest** (public content). The AI stewards are designed as **harvesters** that will handle incoming questions and engagement when NationOS launches publicly.

**Strategic Approach:** Build infrastructure small and solid before public launch. No premature deployment until AI stewards and infrastructure are ready to handle the harvest.

---

**Soli Deo Gloria!**
