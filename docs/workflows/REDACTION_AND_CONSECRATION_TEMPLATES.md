# REDACTION & CONSECRATION WORKFLOW TEMPLATES

**Date:** December 2, 2025  
**Purpose:** Practical templates for processing content through the Sanctuary Protocol  
**Related:** SANCTUARY_PROTOCOL.md

---

## OVERVIEW

These templates provide step-by-step workflows for moving content from raw vulnerability (Holy of Holies) to public proclamation (Outer Court), with appropriate redaction, refinement, and consecration at each stage.

---

## TEMPLATE 1: PERSONAL CONFESSION → TEACHABLE WISDOM

**Use Case:** You have a raw personal struggle or confession that contains a teachable principle.

### STEP 1: RAW CREATION (Holy of Holies)

**Action:** Write/record without filtering

**Prompt Questions:**
- What am I really feeling right now?
- What is the raw, unfiltered truth of this situation?
- What am I afraid to admit, even to myself?
- What is God saying to me in this moment?

**Output:** Raw journal entry, voice recording, or prayer session

**Storage:** Local encrypted drive, labeled `HOH_[DATE]_[TOPIC]_RAW.md`

---

### STEP 2: PROCESSING (with Council)

**Action:** Extract the teachable principle, identify what to redact

**Prompt Questions:**
- What is the universal principle here that others could learn from?
- What details are specific to me and should remain private?
- What would honor God and edify others?
- What would exploit vulnerability or harm relationships?

**Redaction Checklist:**
- [ ] Remove specific names of people involved
- [ ] Remove identifying details about family/friends
- [ ] Remove details that could harm relationships
- [ ] Remove content that is still too raw/unprocessed
- [ ] Keep the core principle and lesson learned

**Output:** Redacted draft with teachable principle extracted
