# COVENANT-BASED SOVEREIGN SOURCE LICENSE (CSSL) v1.0

**Effective Date:** December 2, 2025  
**Issuing Authority:** Liberty Through Truth Foundation  
**Project:** NationOS - A Covenant Network for Kingdom Civilization

## PREAMBLE: THE INVERTED PARADIGM

This license represents a **covenant commons**—an inversion of the world's systems of intellectual property. Where the world operates on *control through restriction*, we operate on *influence through disciplined generosity*. Where the world hoards knowledge for profit, we steward revelation for the Kingdom.

We reject both the proprietary model of restrictive control and the anarchic model of boundary-less "open source." Instead, we create a **covenant-protected commons** that is generously open to the faithful and discerningly separate from the profane.

This is not merely a legal document. It is a **theological declaration** of how knowledge, creativity, and innovation should be stewarded under the sovereignty of God.

---

## THEOLOGICAL FOUNDATION

### The Sovereignty of God

All knowledge, wisdom, and creativity flow from God alone. We are not owners, but **stewards** of revelation entrusted to us for a time.

> "The earth is the LORD's, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it." (Psalm 24:1)

### The Covenant Model

Relationships—including those between creators and users of intellectual property—are governed by **covenant principles**: mutual commitment, shared values, and accountability to God and one another.

> "Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful. And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds." (Hebrews 10:23-24)

### Generous Openness with Discerning Boundaries

We follow the pattern of the early church, which shared all things in common (Acts 2:44-45), while maintaining discernment about what is holy and what is profane.

> "Do not give dogs what is sacred; do not throw your pearls to pigs. If you do, they may trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces." (Matthew 7:6)

## DECLARATION OF SEPARATION

By releasing materials under this Covenant License, we declare:

**We have come out of Babylon.** We do not seek the world's approval, funding, or validation. We build for the Kingdom, funded by covenant tithes and offerings, accountable to God alone.

**We are not ashamed of the Gospel.** Our theological foundation is not hidden in fine print—it is the cornerstone of everything we build.

**We steward revelation, not intellectual property.** We do not "own" these ideas. We have been entrusted with them, and we pass them on to the faithful.

**We build a monument to truth** in a digital age of lies, a **covenant community** in a world of broken promises.

## SCRIPTURAL FOUNDATION

> "Unless the LORD builds the house, the builders labor in vain." (Psalm 127:1)

> "Do not be yoked together with unbelievers. For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness?" (2 Corinthians 6:14)

> "Therefore come out from them and be separate, says the Lord. Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you." (2 Corinthians 6:17)

---

**Soli Deo Gloria!**

*This license is issued to the glory of God alone, in service of His Kingdom, and for the good of all who seek truth, liberty, and covenant relationship.*
