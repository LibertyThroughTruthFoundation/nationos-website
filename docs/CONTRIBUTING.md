# CONTRIBUTING TO NATIONOS

**Welcome, fellow builder of the Kingdom!**

Thank you for your interest in contributing to NationOS. This project is built on the principles of **covenant collaboration**—we work together not merely as independent contractors, but as members of a covenant community, accountable to God and to one another.

## COVENANT PRINCIPLES FOR CONTRIBUTORS

Before contributing, please understand and commit to the following principles:

### 1. **Theological Alignment**

All contributions must align with the foundational theology of the **Sovereign Way Manifesto**, including:

- The sovereignty of God over all creation
- The authority of Scripture (Genesis to Revelation)
- The Divine Council worldview
- Covenant theology as the interpretive framework
- The Lordship of Jesus Christ

**We welcome diverse perspectives** on secondary matters, but the core theological foundation is non-negotiable.

### 2. **Humility & Teachability**

We are all learners in this journey. Approach contributions with humility, recognizing that you may not have the full picture. Be open to correction, feedback, and refinement.

> "Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit. Rather, in humility value others above yourselves." (Philippians 2:3)

### 3. **Excellence & Diligence**

We are building for the glory of God, not merely for human approval. Strive for excellence in your contributions—whether in writing, coding, design, or theology.

> "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters." (Colossians 3:23)

### 4. **Transparency & Integrity**

Be honest about your sources, your limitations, and your intentions. Do not plagiarize, misrepresent, or deceive. If you make a mistake, own it and correct it.

### 5. **Respect & Charity**

Engage with other contributors and reviewers with respect and charity, even when you disagree. Assume good faith, seek to understand before being understood, and prioritize reconciliation over being right.

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

2. Review the **Living Manuscript** (in `docs/knowledge-base/02_HOLY_PLACE_Living_Constitution/`)
3. Familiarize yourself with the **Tabernacle Blueprint** organizational framework
4. Understand the current development priorities (see `docs/changelogs/`)

### **Step 2: Identify Your Contribution Area**

Contributions can take many forms:

**Documentation:**
- Clarifying existing content
- Adding examples or case studies
- Translating materials into other languages
- Creating visual aids (diagrams, infographics)

**Theology:**
- Providing scriptural references
- Expanding on theological concepts
- Offering historical or cultural context
- Reviewing for doctrinal accuracy

**Technical:**
- Improving code or automation workflows
- Creating tools or utilities
- Enhancing infrastructure documentation
- Testing and bug reporting

**Community:**
- Answering questions from seekers
- Moderating discussions
- Creating educational content
- Organizing local covenant communities

### **Step 3: Fork the Repository**

1. Navigate to the [NationOS GitHub repository](https://github.com/LibertyThroughTruthFoundation/nationos-website)
2. Click the "Fork" button to create your own copy
3. Clone your fork to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/nationos-website.git
   ```

### **Step 4: Create a Feature Branch**

Create a new branch for your contribution:

```

**Branch naming conventions:**
- `feature/` for new content or functionality
- `fix/` for corrections or bug fixes
- `docs/` for documentation improvements
- `theology/` for theological refinements

### **Step 5: Make Your Changes**

**Guidelines:**

- **For Holy of Holies content:** Do not modify without explicit Divine Council approval. These are immutable documents.
- **For Holy Place content:** Propose changes via pull request with detailed theological justification.
- **For Outer Court content:** More flexible, but still subject to review for alignment.

**File formatting:**
- Use Markdown (.md) for all text documents
- Follow existing formatting conventions
- Include clear headings and subheadings
- Use proper citations for external sources

**Commit messages:**
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Reference related issues or discussions

Example:
```bash
git commit -m "Add scriptural references to covenant finance section

Expanded the covenant finance documentation with additional Old Testament
references to tithing, jubilee, and debt forgiveness. Includes citations
from Leviticus 25, Deuteronomy 15, and Nehemiah 5."
```

### **Step 6: Submit a Pull Request**

1. Push your changes to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-contribution-name
   ```

2. Navigate to the original NationOS repository
3. Click "New Pull Request"
4. Select your fork and branch
5. Provide a detailed description of your changes:
   - **What** you changed
   - **Why** you made the change
   - **How** it aligns with the Sovereign Way principles
   - Any **theological or technical justification**

### **Step 7: Engage in Review**

The Divine Council will review your pull request. This may involve:

- Questions for clarification
- Requests for modifications
- Theological discussion
- Technical feedback

**Be patient and gracious** during this process. The goal is to ensure that all contributions strengthen the project and maintain covenant alignment.
