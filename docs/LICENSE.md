## THEOLOGICAL FOUNDATION

This license is grounded in the biblical principles of **stewardship** and **covenant**.

**Stewardship:** We recognize that all knowledge, creativity, and resources ultimately belong to God. We are merely stewards, entrusted with these gifts for a time. This license reflects our commitment to use these gifts wisely and to share them generously with others.

> "The earth is the LORD's, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it." (Psalm 24:1)

**Covenant:** We believe that relationships—including those between creators and users of intellectual property—should be governed by covenant principles: mutual commitment, shared values, and accountability to God.

> "Let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess, for he who promised is faithful. And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds." (Hebrews 10:23-24)

1. **Direct dialogue** between the parties
2. **Mediation** by a mutually agreed-upon third party
