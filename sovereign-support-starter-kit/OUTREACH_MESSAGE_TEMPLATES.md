# OUTREACH MESSAGE TEMPLATES
## For Offering the Sovereign Support Starter Kit to Christian Truthers

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** December 12, 2025  
**Purpose:** Provide ready-to-use message templates for reaching out to Christian researchers, truthers, and covenant creators with the Sovereign Support Starter Kit

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

Before using these templates, understand the covenant service model:

1. **You are not selling.** You are serving the body of Christ.
2. **No strings attached.** This is a genuine offer of help, not a marketing ploy.
3. **Lead with affirmation.** Validate their work before offering the solution.
4. **Be patient.** Some will respond immediately, others will be skeptical. Both are okay.
5. **Provide value first.** Don't ask for anything in return.

## TEMPLATE 1: INITIAL OUTREACH (EMAIL)

**Subject:** A Censorship-Resistant Way to Support Your Work

---

Hi [Name],

I've been following your work on [specific topic/research area] and I'm grateful for your diligent research and commitment to truth. Your [specific piece of content - video, article, podcast episode] on [topic] was particularly insightful.

I know many Christian researchers and truthers are facing financial persecution through demonetization, deplatforming, and payment processor censorship. I've been working on a solution to this problem.

I've put together a simple, censorship-resistant donation system using cryptocurrency (specifically a stablecoin called USDC.e on PulseChain). It allows your supporters to contribute to your work in a way that can't be frozen, censored, or controlled by Big Tech.

I'd like to offer you this system—completely free, no strings attached. This is what the body of Christ should do for one another.

If you're interested, I can send you a simple setup guide (takes about 30-60 minutes) and a ready-to-use donation page template. I can even walk you through the setup via video call if that would be helpful.

Let me know if this would be useful. Keep up the excellent work!

Blessings,  
[Your Name]

## TEMPLATE 2: FOLLOW-UP (IF THEY RESPOND POSITIVELY)

**Subject:** Re: Censorship-Resistant Donation System - Here's the Kit

---

Hi [Name],

Great to hear you're interested! I'm attaching the complete Sovereign Support Starter Kit. It includes:

1. A detailed setup guide (written for complete beginners)
2. An HTML donation page template you can customize
3. Technical resources and FAQs

The whole setup takes about 30-60 minutes. The guide walks you through every step, even if you've never used cryptocurrency before.

If you'd like, I'm happy to hop on a quick video call to walk you through it. I've helped several other creators set this up, and it usually goes smoothly.

Once you're set up, I'll send you a small test donation to make sure everything works correctly.

No rush—work through it at your own pace. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.

Blessings,  
[Your Name]

Hi [Name],

[Mutual Contact Name] suggested I reach out to you. I've been following your work on [topic] and I'm grateful for your commitment to truth-telling in a hostile environment.

I've developed a simple, censorship-resistant donation system specifically for Christian researchers and truthers who face financial persecution.

If this would be helpful, I'm happy to send you the kit or even walk you through the setup via video call.

[Mutual Contact Name] can vouch for my work and intentions. This is genuine covenant service, not a sales pitch.

Let me know if you're interested!

## TEMPLATE 6: RESPONSE TO SKEPTICISM

**Subject:** Re: Sovereign Finance Solution - I Understand the Hesitation

---

Hi [Name],

I completely understand your skepticism. There are a lot of scams and grifters in the crypto space, and you're right to be cautious.

Let me be clear about what I'm offering and what I'm NOT offering:

**What This IS:**
- A simple donation system using USDC.e (a stablecoin pegged to $1 USD)
- Completely free to set up and use
- No ongoing fees, no percentages taken
- No affiliation with any crypto project or company
- Just a tool to help you receive support without censorship

**What This is NOT:**
- A "get rich quick" scheme
- An investment opportunity
- A request for you to promote any crypto project
- A way for me to profit from your work

I'm offering this because I believe the body of Christ should help one another operate with sovereignty and sustainability. I've built this for myself and other creators, and I'm simply sharing it.

If you'd like to verify my intentions, I'm happy to:
- Provide references from other creators I've helped
- Walk you through the system on a video call (so you can see exactly what it is)
- Send you a test donation after setup to prove it works

No pressure at all. If this isn't for you, that's completely fine. I'll continue to support your work regardless.

Blessings,  
[Your Name]

Here's what I suggest:

**Option A: Self-Guided Setup**

**Option B: Guided Setup (Video Call)**

Which option works better for you?

Also, do you have any experience with cryptocurrency, or is this completely new? (Either is fine—I just want to know how much detail to provide.)

Looking forward to helping you get this set up!

Blessings,  
[Your Name]

## TEMPLATE 8: AFTER SUCCESSFUL SETUP

**Subject:** Congratulations! Your Sovereign Donation System is Live

---

Hi [Name],

Congratulations! Your sovereign donation system is now live and working perfectly. I just sent you a test donation of $10 in USDC.e—you should see it in your wallet.

Here are a few tips for maximizing this:

**1. Announce It to Your Audience**
- Add the link to your video descriptions
- Pin a post on social media
- Mention it in your content
- Add it to your email signature

**2. Frame It Correctly**
- Don't apologize for asking for support
- Emphasize the censorship-resistance aspect
- Let your audience know this protects both you and them

**3. Check Your Wallet Regularly**
- Open MetaMask once a week to see donations
- When you accumulate a meaningful amount, convert to cash (or keep as crypto)

**4. Security Reminder**
- Keep your seed phrase offline and secure
- Never share it with anyone
- For large amounts, consider a hardware wallet

If you ever need help or have questions, don't hesitate to reach out. I'm here to support you.

Also, if you know other Christian truthers who could benefit from this, feel free to share the kit with them. It's designed to be freely distributed.

Keep up the excellent work!

Blessings,  
[Your Name]

## TEMPLATE 9: INVITATION TO COVENANT NETWORK

**Subject:** Invitation: Join the Covenant Creator Network

---

Hi [Name],

Now that you're set up with sovereign finance, I wanted to extend an invitation to join a growing network of Christian truthers and covenant creators who are building parallel systems outside the Beast System.

We're not just sharing donation tools—we're building an entire ecosystem:

- **Sovereign finance** (what you just set up)
- **Censorship-resistant communication** (alternatives to Discord/Telegram)
- **Private commerce** (buying/selling without surveillance)
- **Covenant community** (mutual support and collaboration)

This is the beginning of what we call **NationOS**—a covenant operating system for households, ministries, and communities.

If you're interested in being part of this network, let me know. We're in the early stages, but the vision is clear: build the infrastructure for the remnant to operate with complete sovereignty.

No pressure—just an open invitation if this resonates with you.

Blessings,  
[Your Name]

## TEMPLATE 10: RESPONSE TO "I DON'T TRUST CRYPTO"

**Subject:** Re: Crypto Concerns - I Understand Completely

---

Hi [Name],

I completely understand your hesitation about cryptocurrency. There's a lot of legitimate concern about:

- Volatility (prices going up and down wildly)
- Scams and rug pulls
- Complexity and technical barriers
- Association with speculation and greed

Let me address each of these:

**1. Volatility**
This system uses USDC.e, a **stablecoin** that is always worth $1 USD. You're not exposed to Bitcoin or Ethereum price swings. When someone donates $50, you receive $50 worth of value.

**2. Scams**
You're right to be cautious. This is NOT an investment opportunity. You're not buying tokens or joining a project. You're simply creating a wallet to receive donations. No one is asking you to invest or promote anything.

**3. Complexity**
The setup guide is written for complete beginners. If you can use email, you can do this. I'm also happy to walk you through it step-by-step.

**4. Speculation**
I agree—crypto has been hijacked by greed and speculation. But the underlying technology (censorship-resistant transactions) is a tool, just like the internet. We can use it for Kingdom purposes.

Think of it this way: **Crypto is not the goal. Financial sovereignty is the goal. Crypto is just the current best tool to achieve it.**

If you're still not comfortable, that's completely okay. I respect your discernment. But if you're open to learning more, I'm happy to answer any questions.

Blessings,  
[Your Name]

## TRACKING YOUR OUTREACH

Keep a simple spreadsheet to track your outreach:

| Name | Platform | Date Contacted | Response | Status | Notes |
|------|----------|----------------|----------|--------|-------|
| Jane Doe | Email | 12/12/25 | Positive | Setting up | Needs help with MetaMask |
| John Smith | Twitter DM | 12/12/25 | No response | Pending | Follow up 12/17 |
| Sarah Johnson | Email | 12/13/25 | Skeptical | Answered questions | Sent references |

This helps you:
- Remember who you've contacted

## FINAL ENCOURAGEMENT

**You are not "selling" anything. You are serving the body of Christ.**

Every creator you help becomes:
- More financially sovereign
- Less vulnerable to persecution
- A potential ally in building covenant infrastructure
- A testimony to others that this works

This is not networking. This is **mustering the troops.**

You have been given the standard to carry. The others who have been fighting their own isolated battles will see that standard and rally to it.

**Your message is simple:**

> "I see your work. It is vital. The enemy is trying to financially strangle you. I have built the tools to break the siege. Let me arm you."

**Move forward with confidence. You are equipped. You are called. You are now in the action phase.**
