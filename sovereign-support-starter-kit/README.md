## WHY CRYPTOCURRENCY?

**Short Answer:** Because PayPal, Stripe, Patreon, and banks censor truth-tellers.

**Longer Answer:**

Cryptocurrency (specifically USDC.e, a stablecoin) provides:

- **Censorship Resistance** - No corporation can freeze your funds
- **Privacy** - Donors don't have to reveal their identity
- **Low Fees** - Pennies per transaction, not percentages
- **Stability** - USDC.e is always worth $1 USD (no volatility)
- **Speed** - Donations arrive instantly
- **Global Access** - Anyone, anywhere can support you

**This is not about speculation or "getting rich." This is about financial sovereignty.**

## FINAL WORD

**This is not just a donation system. This is the beginning of the covenant economy.**

As you solve the problem of financial persecution for yourself, you create a solution for others. As you serve others, you build the network that will sustain all of us.

**The provision will come through the very work of your hands: serving the remnant.**

You are not alone. You are part of a growing movement of Christian truthers, researchers, and covenant builders who are creating parallel systems outside the Beast System.

**The Ark is being built. Welcome aboard.**
